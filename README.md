- 👋 Hi, I’m Himanshi Tiruwa.
- 🔍 I'm passionate about data science, AI, and solving real-world problems — especially in healthcare and education.
- 📚 A true book lover — I can read endlessly, from blogs to non-fiction novels.
- 🌱 Currently strengthening my skills in Python, data analysis, machine learning, and statistics (while tolerating web dev for the grades 😅).
- 🤝 Looking to collaborate on data-centric projects and research-driven work.
- 💌 Let’s connect: himanshitiruwa@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ✨ Fun Fact: Despite being in tech, I dream of opening a cozy reading café one day — where code and coffee meet stories.
