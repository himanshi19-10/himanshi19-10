- 🌱 Currently strengthening my skills in Python, data analysis, machine learning, and statistics (while tolerating web dev for the grades 😅).
- 🤝 Looking to collaborate on data-centric projects, research-driven work, or any initiative with purpose and impact.
- 💌 Let’s connect: himanshitiruwa@gmail.com
